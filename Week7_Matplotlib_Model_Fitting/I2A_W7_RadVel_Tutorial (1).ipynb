    "# Radial Velocity Orbit-fitting with RadVel\n",

    "## Background information\n",
    "Radial velocity measurements tell us how the velocity of a star changes along the direction of our line of sight. These measurements are made using Doppler Spectroscopy, which looks at the spectrum of a star and measures shifts in known absorption lines. Here is a nice [GIF](https://polytechexo.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/spectro.gif) showing the movement of a star due to the presence of an orbiting planet, the shift in the stellar spectrum, and the corresponding radial velocity measurements. \n",

    "This tutorial will cover a lot of new topics and build on ones we just learned. We don't have time to review all of them right now, so you're encouraged to read the following references before coming back to complete the tutorial as one of your weekly assignments.\n",

    "## About this tutorial\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use the California Planet Search Python package [RadVel](https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/radvel) to characterize the exoplanets orbiting the star K2-24 (EPIC 203771098) using radial velocity measurements. This tutorial is a modification of the \"[K2-24 Fitting & MCMC](https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/radvel/blob/master/docs/tutorials/K2-24_Fitting%2BMCMC.ipynb)\" tutorial on the RadVel GitHub page. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several coding tasks for you to accomplish in this tutorial. Each task is indicated by a `#TODO` comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- estimate planetary orbital periods using a periodogram\n",
    "- perform a maximum likelihood orbit fit with RadVel \n",
    "- create a residuals plot\n",
    "- perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fit to characterize orbital parameter uncertainty\n",

It shows how much each contributing function's frequency contributes to the data model. The larger the peak in the graph, the more significant that frequency is in the data. We use this frequency to get an idea of periodic behaivor in the data (e.g. the orbital period of an exoplanet). Now, we will calculate a periodogram and use it to give us an estimate of the period of the planet's orbit."
